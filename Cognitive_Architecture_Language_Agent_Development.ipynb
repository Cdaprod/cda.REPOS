    "# Cognitive Architecture & Language Agent Development Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of the integration of Cognitive Architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs), and the MetaGPT repository for the development of advanced language agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "# import openai\n",
    "# import langchain\n",
    "# import MetaGPT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring Cognitive Architectures\n",
    "Cognitive architectures like Soar are foundational for understanding the agent's state and decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "LLMs such as GPT-4 offer advanced capabilities for text understanding and generation, essential for language agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Incorporating MetaGPT\n",
    "MetaGPT extends the capabilities of traditional LLMs, providing a robust framework for developing language agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developing a Language Agent\n",
    "Here we outline the step-by-step process to create a language agent using cognitive architecture principles, LLMs, and MetaGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study: Interactive Code Generation\n",
    "A practical application of the language agent in code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "Methods to test and evaluate the agentâ€™s performance in various scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion and Future Directions\n",
