Each of these chains represents a high-level outline. Integration with MinIO/Weaviate services and OpenAI's API requires further development based on your exact system and requirements.

To integrate clients for MinIO into your LangChain and LangServe setup, follow these steps:

1. **Install MinIO Client**:
   - Ensure you have the MinIO client library installed in your environment. If not, install it using pip: `pip install minio`.

2. **Create MinIO Client Instances**:
   - In your chain files (inside the `/chains/` directory), instantiate the MinIO client with the necessary credentials and configurations.

3. **Example MinIO Client Setup**:
   - In `list_buckets_chain.py`:
     ```python
     from minio import Minio

     class ListBucketsChain(LLMChain):
         def __init__(self, minio_client, ...):
             self.minio_client = minio_client
             ...

         def _call(self, inputs, run_manager=None):
             # MinIO interaction
             buckets = self.minio_client.list_buckets()
             ...
     ```
   - Repeat similar setups for other chain files where MinIO interactions are needed.

4. **Pass MinIO Client to Chains**:
   - In your `server.py`, create a MinIO client instance and pass it to your chain instances.
   - Example in `server.py`:
     ```python
     from minio import Minio
     from chains.list_buckets_chain import ListBucketsChain

     minio_client = Minio("MINIO_ENDPOINT", access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY")

     list_buckets_chain = ListBucketsChain(minio_client, ...)

     app = FastAPI()
     add_routes(app, list_buckets_chain, path="/listbuckets")
     ...
     ```

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the integration by running the server and using the API endpoints to interact with MinIO through your chains.

By following these steps, you integrate MinIO clients into your LangChain chains, allowing them to interact directly with MinIO services. Ensure that all MinIO credentials and endpoint details are correctly configured for successful integration.
