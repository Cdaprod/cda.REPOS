In the LlamaIndex Python documentation, I couldn't find a specific S3 loader. However, LlamaIndex likely supports various methods of loading data, which might include S3 loaders, but the information was not explicitly available in the documentation I accessed.

On the other hand, LangChain does have an `S3FileLoader` class for loading files from S3. The `S3FileLoader` class is used to load files from an S3 bucket. This loader requires the `bucket_name` and `s3_prefix` as initialization parameters. Here's a snippet of how to initialize and use this loader:

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import S3FileLoader

# Initialize the S3FileLoader
s3_loader = S3FileLoader(bucket_name="your-bucket-name", s3_prefix="your-prefix")

# Load data
data = s3_loader.load()
```

This loader can be particularly useful if you have data stored in S3-compatible storage solutions like MinIO, as it can directly load files from these buckets【191†source】【192†source】.
