Factoring your homelab data lake project as Kubernetes (K8s) manifests involves creating a set of YAML files that define how each component should be deployed and managed within a Kubernetes cluster. Below are the key components structured as Kubernetes manifests, keeping in mind the different services like MinIO, Langchain, and your interfacing applications.

### 1. **Metastore Service**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: metastore-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: metastore
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: metastore-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: metastore
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: metastore
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: metastore
        image: metastore:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9376
```

### 2. **Featurestore Microservices**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: featurestore-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: featurestore
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9377
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: featurestore-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: featurestore
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: featurestore
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: featurestore
        image: featurestore:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9377
```

### 3. **Videostore Deployment**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: videostore-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: videostore
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9378
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: videostore-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: videostore
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: videostore
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: videostore
        image: videostore:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9378
```

### 4. **Web App and Chatbot**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: webapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

### Notes:

- **Replicas**: The number of replicas for each deployment is set based on the expected load. This can be adjusted for scalability.
- **Port Configuration**: The service ports and target ports are placeholders and should be adjusted according to the actual ports your applications use.
- **Image**: Replace `metastore:latest`, `featurestore:latest`, etc., with the actual image names and tags of your Docker containers.
- **Persistent Storage**: Depending on the statefulness of your applications, you may need to add Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to ensure data persistence.
- **Resource Limits**: Define CPU and memory limits for each container for efficient resource utilization.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: If your applications require configuration files or secret keys, use ConfigMaps and Secrets respectively.
- **Ingress or Load Balancer**: To expose your services outside the cluster, consider using Ingress controllers or LoadBalancer services.

This Kubernetes setup provides a scalable and manageable framework for your homelab data lake, aligning with modern cloud-native practices.
